# GEM-STEP Foundation

The Generalized Embodied Modeling STEP project aims to support learners of all ages in developing their own hybrid embodied models through a combination of scripting and play.  For more information about the project, please visit our website: [https://embodiedplay.org/](https://embodiedplay.org/).

This is a monorepo for managing all the related packages for GEM-STEP, managed with lerna/npm. It is under active development in a very early stage.

The GEM-STEP system consists of:

* A simulation server
* Any number of character controller laptop, chromebook, or tablet devices
* Any number of script editor laptop, chromebook, or tablet devices
* Any number of simulation viewer laptop, chromebook, or tablet devices
* An optional Pozyx tracking system
* An optional OpenPTrack tracking system
