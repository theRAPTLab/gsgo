# GEM-STEP Foundation

This is our new monorepo for managing all the related packages for GEM-STEP, managed with lerna/npm. 

## First Time Installation

If you have not installed the development tools required to run the project, you'll have to do this once. Follow the instructions in [`docs/20-tooling/20-dev-install.md`](docs/20-tooling/20-dev-install.md). Currently we support MacOS Mojave or later, and hopefully will also support Ubuntu.
