SRI'S GRAPHQL EXAMPLES

You send one query at a time. Each of these examples would be sent in an independent
query action e.g. UR.Query(queryString, variables).
The returned data will match the shape of your query. The general idea is to explicitly
specify which properties of a type to retrieve. If a prop is defined as a custom type
(not one of the primitive String, Float, Int, ID, or [] types), you need to further specify
the props to "drill into" the type

Hopefully these examples will help
"""

"""
This query is labeled 'getLocales', but this label has no use in data fetching.
It IS used in GraphIQL (access via 'http://localhost/urnet/urdb') to run a selected
query or mutation.

"locales" is one of the defined Query methods defined in schema.graphql. It will
return an array of { id, name } objects, as "locales" is defined in the schema.graphql
file as returning an array of Locale types. This can be used to populate a dropdown
menu!

We also see a single line comment
"""
query getLocales {
  locales {
    id
    name
  }
}

"""
'getLocale' takes a single variable, id.  It will return an object with id, stage, gemstep
ptrack, pozyx and ursys fields, all which are defined in the 'Locale' type defined in the
schema. We are only requesting some of the information. Each of the fields is defined
as returning its on type (e.g. StageProps, StepProps, etc.)
"""
query getLocale {
  locale(id: 1) {
    id
    stage {
      memo
    }
    gemstep {
      memo

    ptrack {
      memo
    }
    pozyx {
      memo
    }
    ursys {
      memo
    }
  }
}

"""
'getLocale2' shows how using the same method 'locale' can be used to retrieve a different
shaped object. 
"""
query getLocale2 {
  locale(id: 2) {
    id
    ptrack {
      xRange

"""
Mutations send data. In this 'update' mutation, the API method 'updatePTrack' is
being invoked; it's defined in schema.graphql.
A list of key-value parameters is being sent: 'localeID' and 'input'

NOTES:
* after you submit the data, you can automatically get data returned. Here,
  the 'memo' field is being returned. This is a property of the Locale type.

mutation update {
  updatePTrack(localeID: 1, input: { memo: "20 Nuggets" }) {
    memo
  }
}

"""
This mutation 'updatePTrack' shows how you use the same method 'updatePTrack' to
change DIFFERENT properties of the input. It is up to the code in resolvers.js to
figure out how to merge that data into the specified record (in this case, locale with
localeID 1)

  updatePTrack(localeID: 1, input: { xScale: 250, yScale: 250 }) {

"""
This query makes use of GraphQL "fragments", which can specify a subset of
fields you want to retrieve. You must sent the fragment declaration in the
query itself, which is useful when requesting multiple queries at a time
