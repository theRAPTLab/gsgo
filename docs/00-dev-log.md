# SPRINT 25

**STILL TO IMPLEMENT**

* [x] an agent or agent template that can be created
* [ ] static or faketrack controls

## DEC 08 TUE - Picking Up

Ben's been implementing some kind of scripting UI. I'm trying to remember what to do next. I just **refactored datacore** in anticipation of managing the `INSTANCES` map. This is an array of initializer programs for each agent instance, since they could all be different. These can be null programs too, but this is what we need to maintain a list of instances.

So...how does this work?

* Instances have an initialization program that sets unique starting values. This is produced by the transpiler as the `init` program in TSMCBundle.
* I should change the pragma also for output libraries.

**ADDITIONAL THINGS TO IMPLEMENT**

+ set the skin from a list of assets? - good
+ some way to load/save? - make cheese API to save a file (port)
  + include both templates and instance list
+ simple prop set like nectar count - we have
+ get faketrack integrated into Movement feature
+ spawn list for instancing
+ how to show the selection dropdown for each type
+ Target Content Areas
  + Use Fish/Algae content area to model: x-gemscript (aquatic_blueprints001.gs)
  + If we get done, move to blueprints002.gs (advanced)

* After I get OnTick working as the basic scriptevent in the user event system, will outline what's in the current engine as of today for the team, with an eye toward using this a foundation for introducing how to write simulations with it (a kind of informational and concise primer?) Then afterwards document the most recent things.

**TODO** AFTER ALPHA DEC 1

* **parameter passing** between scripts is kind of ambiguous, because of the number of execution contexts. Need to document all the execution contexts and try to make sense of it.
* no **filter result caching** in place yet
* no real tests implemented yet
* combine test functions into functions table, require that name begins with TEST_AB, TEST_A, or TEST
* the state object needs to have its **context** loaded so this values are available at runtime. How do we insert it before it runs? Maybe 
* provide a better debug output experience
* make sure that Agent blueprint inheritance is implemented
* `queueSequence [[ ]] [[ ]] [[ ]] ...`
* `on TimeElapsed 1000 [[ ... ]]`

**BACKLOG**

```
Renderer + Display Lists
[ ] implement/test entity broadcasts
[ ] how to integrate multiple display lists together?

Network:
[ ] design device persistant naming and reconnection between reloads
[ ] maybe use JWT to establish identities? 

Input:
[ ] Read Event List
[ ] Update Display Object from events that change things
[ ] Convert local interactions to Agent or Display Object changes
[ ] Write Event List

Runtime:
[ ] Create Agent Template
[ ] Instance Agent Template
[ ] Control

Observations:
[ ] NOTE: The difference between PhaseMachine and messages synchronicity
[ ] extension: text script format `[define]` to output a define bundle, etc
```
