# FUTURE QUEUE

+ set the skin from a list of assets? - good
+ some way to load/save? - make cheese API to save a file (port)
  + include both templates and instance list
+ simple prop set like nectar count - we have
+ get faketrack integrated into Movement feature
+ spawn list for instancing
+ how to show the selection dropdown for each type
+ Target Content Areas
  + Use Fish/Algae content area to model: x-gemscript (aquatic_blueprints001.gs)
  + If we get done, move to blueprints002.gs (advanced)

* After I get OnTick working as the basic scriptevent in the user event system, will outline what's in the current engine as of today for the team, with an eye toward using this a foundation for introducing how to write simulations with it (a kind of informational and concise primer?) Then afterwards document the most recent things.

**TODO** AFTER ALPHA DEC 1

* **parameter passing** between scripts is kind of ambiguous, because of the number of execution contexts. Need to document all the execution contexts and try to make sense of it.
* no **filter result caching** in place yet
* no real tests implemented yet
* combine test functions into functions table, require that name begins with TEST_AB, TEST_A, or TEST
* the state object needs to have its **context** loaded so this values are available at runtime. How do we insert it before it runs? Maybe 
* provide a better debug output experience
* make sure that Agent blueprint inheritance is implemented
* `queueSequence [[ ]] [[ ]] [[ ]] ...`
* `on TimeElapsed 1000 [[ ... ]]`

**BACKLOG**

```
Renderer + Display Lists
[ ] implement/test entity broadcasts
[ ] how to integrate multiple display lists together?
[ ] finalizing coordinate system
[ ] bring back location

Network:
[ ] design device persistant naming and reconnection between reloads
[ ] maybe use JWT to establish identities? 

Input:
[ ] Read Event List
[ ] Update Display Object from events that change things
[ ] Convert local interactions to Agent or Display Object changes
[ ] Write Event List
[ ] Important formal input mechanisms
[ ] Asset capture 

Observations:
[ ] NOTE: The difference between PhaseMachine and messages synchronicity
[ ] extension: text script format `[define]` to output a define bundle, etc

Conditional When Engine:
[ ] slow...speed it up

Persistant Data
[ ] server?
[ ] assets?
[ ] bundle-based asset management outside of git?
[ ] handle app packaging, asset packing, identitifying groups, students, orgs that it belongs to. 

```
