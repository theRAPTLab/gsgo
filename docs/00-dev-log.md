# SPRINT 2103 - FEB 08 - FEB 21

* **TODO** - make sure can pass parameters to tests
* **TODO** fix `when` to be able to pass parameters to tests
* **TODO** - add stack operations for gvars and keywords

This sprint is for **adding FakeTrack** input as well as related systems for **device directory and input management**, possibly also **distributed state updates**. 

## FEB 09 TUE - Designing Input Manager

There are two parts to this:

(1) Device Addressibility

* Main Server (on WAN) is for LAPTOPS to connect to a SIMULATION SERVER
  * simulation server is a beefy laptop
  * is an URSYS endpoint
* Connecting devices select the role they want to use (this chooses the app)
  * First  come, first served for roles
  * Chromebooks for Script Editor, iPads for annotation/viewing
* The global simulation state is owned by Simulation Server
  * global simulation state is distributed to all devices

(2) Input Routing

* Inputs are Devices with Roles and InputType

I started `step/wip-role-mgr` to start blocking out functions. Putting it aside and looking now at adding some script keywords.

### Script Improvements

Switching to this...let's first look at **stack operations**: I think what we want to do is add `push()` and `pop()` to the gvars through `SMObject`

* [ ] The gvar methods don't have access to `state` because they are invoked with parameters, so we need to do a bit of massaging in the keywords themselves
* [ ] in `p[methodName](...args);` this is invoking the method name with args. Maybe we need a variation called `pushProp`?
* [ ] Alternatively, maybe we need to make all the gvar methods accessible as methods?
* [ ] Maybe we can always return the value by shoving the last returned value into an accumulator?
* [ ] how to write `prop agent.x setTo agent.y` ?
  * [ ] as `propPush` and `propPop`

## FEB 10 WED - bug fixing featPropPush

#### BUG

There's a **bug** with featPropPush() where ref[0] for `featPropPush agent.Costume.costumeName` is undefined instead of 'agent'

* [ ] the `refArg` coming into the compile() is already incorrect. This is produced by TRANSPILER
* [ ] compile() is called by r_CompileUnit() which calls r_ExpandArgs()
* [ ] `r_DecodeArg()` is already getting a bogus objref, so it's probably happening in `ScriptifyText()`
* [ ] so let's check `class-gscript-tokenizer` to **ensure there are no bugs in it**

There were several parse and logic bugs after running all the compiler tests. Seems to work now

* [x] featPropPush works?
* [x] featProp works?
* [x] prop works/
* [x] dbgStack works?
* [x] propPush works
* [x] propPop works?
* [x] featPropPop works?
* [x] dbgOut works?
  * [x] crash on objref
  * [x] no works on expression
  * [x] added agent context to passed contet
* [x] setCostume is wrapping things in multiple [ ] 
  * [x] state.pop was returning an array for a single item pop

### Stack Operations

* [x] propPush, featPropPush - uses objrefs only, not expressions
* [x] propPop, featPropPop - uses objrefs only, not expressions
* [x] state.pop() fixed to return default top value, not an array of one value
* [ ] dbgOut - can it still handle expressions?
* [ ] prop - can it handle expression assignments?
* [ ] prop - can it handle objref assignments?
* [ ] dbgOut, dbgStack - better way to implement output limits?

**ADDITIONAL THINGS TO IMPLEMENT**

+ set the skin from a list of assets? - good
+ some way to load/save? - make cheese API to save a file (port)
  + include both templates and instance list
+ simple prop set like nectar count - we have
+ get faketrack integrated into Movement feature
+ spawn list for instancing
+ how to show the selection dropdown for each type
+ Target Content Areas
  + Use Fish/Algae content area to model: x-gemscript (aquatic_blueprints001.gs)
  + If we get done, move to blueprints002.gs (advanced)

* After I get OnTick working as the basic scriptevent in the user event system, will outline what's in the current engine as of today for the team, with an eye toward using this a foundation for introducing how to write simulations with it (a kind of informational and concise primer?) Then afterwards document the most recent things.

**TODO** AFTER ALPHA DEC 1

* **parameter passing** between scripts is kind of ambiguous, because of the number of execution contexts. Need to document all the execution contexts and try to make sense of it.
* no **filter result caching** in place yet
* no real tests implemented yet
* combine test functions into functions table, require that name begins with TEST_AB, TEST_A, or TEST
* the state object needs to have its **context** loaded so this values are available at runtime. How do we insert it before it runs? Maybe 
* provide a better debug output experience
* make sure that Agent blueprint inheritance is implemented
* `queueSequence [[ ]] [[ ]] [[ ]] ...`
* `on TimeElapsed 1000 [[ ... ]]`

**BACKLOG**

```
Renderer + Display Lists
[ ] implement/test entity broadcasts
[ ] how to integrate multiple display lists together?
[ ] finalizing coordinate system
[ ] bring back location

Network:
[ ] design device persistant naming and reconnection between reloads
[ ] maybe use JWT to establish identities? 

Input:
[ ] Read Event List
[ ] Update Display Object from events that change things
[ ] Convert local interactions to Agent or Display Object changes
[ ] Write Event List
[ ] Important formal input mechanisms
[ ] Asset capture 

Observations:
[ ] NOTE: The difference between PhaseMachine and messages synchronicity
[ ] extension: text script format `[define]` to output a define bundle, etc

Conditional When Engine:
[ ] slow...speed it up

Persistant Data
[ ] server?
[ ] assets?
[ ] bundle-based asset management outside of git?
[ ] handle app packaging, asset packing, identitifying groups, students, orgs that it belongs to.
